Historically, the Word application (technically speaking a Word instance) is required to create, print or edit a Word document in it. 
This applies to both the user and the developer.

But this is becoming an obstacle:
- Since the Word application was primarily designed for the user, it is more difficult to use it in a server environment. 
However, more and more services are being performed by server applications, which is increasingly restricting the timeliness and usefulness of conventional Word documents.
- The programming interfaces are comparatively slow - especially when Word is controlled from the outside; not least because the preview is updated continuously. 
In addition, the remote control has to work through several COM interfaces, which further slows down the execution.
- Documents are increasingly no longer archived in paper form, but digitally. 
The old, proprietary binary file formats are poorly suited for this.
- And finally, the spirit of the times calls for open standards and files that are not reserved for non-proprietary software. A new file format for core office applications was required.

The result was introduced in Office 2007: Office Open XML. It replaces the previously used binary file formats. 
This chapter provides an introduction to the structure of Open XML documents and how to use them. 
Unfortunately, the VBA developer has no tailored tools to work with the new file format. 
Nevertheless, this chapter is intended to serve as a basis for understanding the new structures.

TIP: Some document damage problems can be solved by manually intervening in the XML files based on the document!

In the next chapter, we present a tool that takes over the structure management described in this chapter, so that the developer can concentrate on working with the document content.
